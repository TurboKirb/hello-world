# hello-world
This is a first-test repository.

I'm relatively new to coding. I'm currently learning Python from scratch using resources like codeacademy.com and freecodecamp.com. 
I don't really know what else to say except that I have a lot to learn.

I am 27 years old and currently live in Mississippi. I work with a finance company as a full-time credit analyst.
